# ma-GCam App Configuration Guide

This is the ma-GCam configuration guide for an enhanced photography experience on your Android device! Follow these simple steps to unlock MAGIC!

Step 1 - Download and Install Camera.apk

Step 2 - Download and Extract Configs.zip

Step 3 - Open the installed Camera app and grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

Step 4 - Adjust File Access Permissions [Very Very Important Step]

Close the Camera app. Open the app info for the Camera app. Manually set the highest priority for file access permissions by selecting "Allow management of all files."
On Realme, Oppo, and OnePlus devices, ensure both "Photos and videos" and "Storage" permissions are granted.

Step 5 - Open the camera app, swipe down on the viewfinder to access settings. Scroll all the way down and tap on "Configs" > tap on "Save" provide a random name and this will create the directory to store your config files.

Step 6 - Open the folder that you extracted in Step 2, select all and copy all the config files (files with .xml). Navigate to your file manager and go to internal storage > GCam > Configs7. Delete the existing random config file if present. Move all the extracted config files (.xml files) from Step 2 to the Configs7 folder.

Step 7 - Apply Configurations

Open the Camera app. Double tap anywhere on the black area next to the shutter button. Choose the desired configuration file to apply the settings.

Experiment with your taste and creativity with all the config files provided. My personal favorites is the Polaroid special edition. I don't remember other names as it's been ages since I have used them.

It is suggested not to change much of the setting of the camera app. Just load the configuration you want and shoot.

Note - I am not sure if it works with MediaTek devices. On Snapdragon it is smooth tho
